 * phone. This is a tool its owner uses repeatedly and deliberately, and eight
 * pages to start a run they will start again tomorrow is friction with nothing on
 * the other side of it. The grouping, the hints and the error summary are kept;
 * the pagination is not.
 *
 * Everything except the paper itself degrades. A model this build cannot reach,
 * an effort it will not take, an unknown depth — each falls back to a default
 * rather than failing a submission over a dropdown. Sealing is the one field that
 * does not, because a reader who ticked the box and got an unsealed run would
 * have handed an unpublished paper to a system they were told would destroy it.
