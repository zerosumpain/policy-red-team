/**
 * The journey, driven in a browser: submit a paper, watch it run, read the report.
 *
 * This is phase 4's gate. It runs against `dist/server-fixture.js`, which is
 * compiled with no path to a model provider at all — so the walk exercises the
 * real HTTP layer, the real queue, the real store and the real React, and cannot
 * spend a penny doing it.
 *
 * axe runs on every page it lands on, including the two that only exist while a
 * run is in flight. Those are the pages `npm run a11y` cannot reach on its own,
 * because they need an assessment to exist.
