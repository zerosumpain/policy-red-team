/**
 * The journey, driven in a browser: submit a paper, watch it run, read the report.

 * This is phase 4's gate. It runs against `dist/server-fixture.js`, which is

 * real HTTP layer, the real queue, the real store and the real React, and cannot
 * spend a penny doing it.
 *
 * axe runs on every page it lands on, including the two that only exist while a
 * run is in flight. Those are the pages `npm run a11y` cannot reach on its own,
 * because they need an assessment to exist.

   * A tenant with local authentication switched off has no key to type, which
   * until phase 18 meant the service could not be configured at all. Four modes
   * now share one form and `showWhen` reveals only what the chosen one needs —
   * eight fields of which a reader fills in one to three.
   *
   * This is browser behaviour and there is no jsdom in this repo, so the walk is
   * the only thing that can see it. Without this assertion the conditional
   * rendering could break and every gate would stay green.
