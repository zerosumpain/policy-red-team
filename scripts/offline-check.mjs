/**
 * The pack, opened the way a reader opens it: double-clicked, with no network.
 *
 * This is phase 5's gate, and it is deliberately not a unit test. `pack.test.ts`
 * asserts rules about the bytes — no `<link>`, no `url(/…)`, everything inline.
 * Those are proxies. This opens the actual file from `file://` in a real browser
 * with every request blocked, and checks the report is on the screen.
 *
 * ROUTE BLOCKING IS THE POINT. Playwright's `**\/*` route handler aborts every
 * request the page makes. A pack that quietly depended on a CDN would render
 * here and fail in the room with no wifi, which is the one place it exists for.
