/**
 * The server.
 *
 * One process: the HTTP listener, the static client, and the worker that runs
 * assessments. Upstream splits those into a web container and a worker container
 * because several web replicas share one queue; here there is one of everything,
 * and a second process would be two things to start.
 *
 * IT BINDS TO LOOPBACK, AND THAT IS THE SECURITY MODEL. There is no session, no
 * password and no owner check per request, because the tool belongs to whoever is
 * at the machine. That is a reasonable design for something local and a terrible
 * one for something on a network, so binding anywhere else needs
 * `POLICY_HOST` set deliberately — and it says out loud what that means.
 */
/*
 * FIRST, AND THE ORDER IS THE POINT. `$lib/db` reads `POLICY_DATA_DIR` while it
 * is being evaluated, so a `.env` loaded any later than this is a `.env` that
 * does not decide where the database lives. See `src/lib/load-env.ts`.
 *
 * This file never loaded one at all, which made `cp .env.example .env` — the
 * README's first instruction — configure nothing.
