/**
 * THE ADMIN API — the only part of this service behind a password.
 *
 * Everything here changes what the install does or holds a credential, so the
 * whole branch is gated before any handler runs. The gate is a signed cookie
 * (`$lib/server/admin-auth`), NOT an address check: behind a tunnel every
 * request arrives from 127.0.0.1, so "local connections only" is a gate that
 * passes for the entire internet — the mistake that took the author's main site
 * down for 33 hours.
 *
 * A SECRET GOES IN AND DOES NOT COME OUT. `GET /api/admin/config` reports
 * whether each secret is set, never its value, so a screenshot, a proxy log or a
 * browser cache between here and the reader carries nothing worth having. The
 * same posture the share token had, for the same reason.
 *
 * SIGNING IN IS RATE LIMITED. A password reachable from the open internet with
 * unlimited attempts is a password with a deadline, and the limiter this repo
 * already has is a token bucket per source — which behind a tunnel is one
 * bucket for everyone, and that is the conservative direction.
