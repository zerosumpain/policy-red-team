/**
 * Bundling the CLI.
 *
 * The copied core imports through the `$lib/*` alias — deliberately, so its files
 * stay byte-identical to upstream's — and Node cannot resolve that. esbuild can,
 * which is also how upstream ships its worker (`packages/jkai-policy-worker/build.mjs`),
 * so this follows that file rather than inventing a second approach.
 *
 * TWO ENTRIES from one source:
 *
 *   dist/cli.js          the real thing; calls a model, costs money
 *   dist/cli-fixture.js  `./provider` aliased to `./provider.fixture`, so the
 *                        bundle has no path to a provider at all
 *
 * The fixture build is how eighteen stages get verified without an API key. A
 * runtime flag would have been easier and weaker: this one cannot be mis-set,
 * and the check below proves it by refusing a bundle that still mentions
 * OpenRouter.
