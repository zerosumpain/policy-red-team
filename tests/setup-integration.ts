/**
 * What an integration run needs before the first test: a migrated, throwaway
 * database and a throwaway key directory.
 *
 * THE DIRECTORY IS THE SAFETY GUARD. Upstream refuses to run these tests unless
 * `DATABASE_URL` points at its isolated Postgres on port 15435 — a regex, because
 * the cost of getting it wrong is a purge test running against real data. This
 * build has no connection string to inspect, so the same promise is kept a
 * different way: the data directory is created here, under the system temp
 * directory, and the tests refuse to run unless `POLICY_DATA_DIR` names a path
 * this file chose. Pointing the suite at a real install is not something you can
 * do by setting one variable.
