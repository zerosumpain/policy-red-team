/**
 * Shedding order: the further an artefact sits from the reasoning a stage is

 *
 * The shipped ranking put everything except retrieved sources and passages into
 * ONE tier and broke ties on confidence. That is backwards, because a literal
 * extraction from the document is near-certain by construction and a judgement
 * about an actor's incentives is not — so the derived layer always went first.
 *
 * Measured on the first assessment to reach the end (2026-09-10, a 20-page paper
 * yielding 635 artefacts): stages 7, 9, 10 and 12 each ran on claims and evidence
 * with ZERO models, tests, scenarios or assumptions in context. The exploitation
 * playbook — the point of the whole assessment — was written with one of
 * eighteen actor profiles, and that one only because the call pinned it. Asked
 * for conclusions citing results it had never been shown, the model minted
 * plausible identifiers for them, every finding was then quarantined for citing
 * an unavailable source, and synthesis failed reporting the missing chapters
 * rather than the cause.
 *
 * So shed the material a later stage has already consumed and superseded — the
 * retrieved text behind an `evidence` row, the passage behind a `claim` — and
 * keep the conclusions. Confidence remains the tiebreak WITHIN a tier, where it
 * compares like with like.
