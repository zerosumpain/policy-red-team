/**
 * WHAT THIS INSTALL IS CONFIGURED TO DO, AND THE CREDENTIALS THAT LET IT.
 *
 * Until now the answer was `.env`, which is right for a tool with one user who
 * has a shell on the machine and wrong for one that offers to connect a
 * subscription. This is the store behind the admin panel.
 *
 * ENCRYPTED AT REST, WITH THE KEY OUTSIDE THE DATABASE. The same AES-GCM as
 * everything else here — `encryptWith` from `$lib/secrets/crypto`, one
 * implementation rather than a second chance to get IV handling wrong — against
 * a key held in a 0600 file beside the sealed-run keys. That placement is the
 * point: a database dump, a nightly backup or a restic snapshot carries the
 * ciphertext and not the key, which is the property sealed runs already rely on.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT STILL WINS. A value in `app.env` overrides anything stored here,
 * so a deployment managed by Ansible keeps behaving the way its files say it
 * does and nobody has to wonder which of two sources is live. The panel says
 * which is in force rather than pretending it owns the answer.
 *
 * A SECRET IS WRITE-ONLY from the outside. `readConfig` is server-side; the
 * panel gets `redact()` and nothing else, for the same reason the share token
 * was shown once: a value the server will read back out is a value that leaks
 * through every log and cache between here and the reader.
