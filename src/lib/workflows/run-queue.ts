/**
 * The run queue, for one worker in one process.
 *
 * Upstream this coordinates a FLEET: `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so several
 * workers can poll the same table without ever being handed the same row, leases
 * that expire so a worker dying mid-run returns its claim, a heartbeat reaper,
 * and a carve-out deciding whether the site's generic worker or the dedicated
 * policy worker owns a policy run. A standalone install has one worker, one
 * process and one connection, so all of that is machinery against a race that
 * cannot happen.
 *
 * What is KEPT, and why:
 *
 *   The lease columns, because the copied cancel, purge and progress paths in
 *   `server/store.ts` read them, and because a lease that is visibly held is how
 *   a crashed run is told from a running one on restart.
 *
 *   `started_at <= now()`, because it is not a fleet feature — it is how the
 *   pipeline SCHEDULES ITSELF. `store.ts` enqueues the next stage with
 *   `startedAt: now + delayMs`, and a claim that ignored it would run every stage
 *   immediately and defeat the pacing.
 *
 * What is DROPPED: `SKIP LOCKED` (nothing to skip past on a single connection)
 * and the worker-ownership carve-out (there is one owner).
