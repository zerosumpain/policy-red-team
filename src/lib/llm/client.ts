/**
 * The model gateway.
 *
 * Upstream this routes between OpenRouter and a local Codex bridge, falls back
 * from one to the other on a credit outage, reads its key and its model defaults
 * from a settings table, and installs a usage capture that writes every call to
 * the site's cost ledger. None of that infrastructure exists here.
 *
 * What is left is what the pipeline actually asks for — `getLLMClient`, which
 * hands back a client and the model id to call it with. WHICH SERVICE ANSWERS is
 * now a configured thing rather than a compiled one: see
 * `$lib/llm/providers`, one module per service, and the admin panel that fills
 * them in.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT BEATS THE STORE, ALWAYS. A key in `app.env` wins over anything the
 * panel holds, so a deployment managed by Ansible keeps doing what its files say
 * and nobody has to work out which of two sources is live. `resolveProvider`
 * reports which one is in force and the panel prints it.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT READ `ctx.provider`. That field belongs to the pipeline's own
 * `ModelContext` — a COPIED type — and records what an assessment was run on.
 * The service that answers is this module's business, and keeping the two
 * vocabularies apart is what lets the whole registry exist without a divergence.
 *
 * COST IS STILL RECORDED, just not centrally: the pipeline writes its own audit
 * to `policy_model_calls` through `server/provider.ts`, and it records the model
 * the API SAID answered — so a provider that serves a deployment rather than the
 * requested id is written down honestly.
