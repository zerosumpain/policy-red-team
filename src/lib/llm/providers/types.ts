/**
 * WHERE A MODEL CALL GOES, AND ON WHOSE BILL.
 *
 * `getLLMClient` used to hard-code one OpenRouter key read from the environment,
 * which is right for a tool with one user and a `.env` and wrong the moment
 * somebody wants to point it at a subscription they already pay for. This is the
 * registry that replaces it: one module per service, each owning its own fields,
 * its own client and its own account of what it costs.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT TOUCH `ModelProvider`. That union — `'openrouter' | 'codex'` — is
 * in a COPIED file and belongs to the pipeline's own `ModelContext`, which
 * records what an assessment was run on. Extending it would be a divergence on a
 * file the fork keeps byte-identical, for no gain: the pipeline never chooses a
 * service, it asks for a model and the registry decides who serves it. The two
 * vocabularies stay separate on purpose.
 *
 * REMOVING A PROVIDER IS DELETING A FILE. Each is self-contained and the registry
 * is a list; `POLICY_PROVIDERS` narrows that list without a rebuild. A build that
 * ships to other people drops `codex` — which is a local bridge against one
 * person's subscription and no use to anyone else — by naming the two that stay.
