/**
 * THE REGISTRY, AND WHAT A BUILD OFFERS.
 *
 * Every provider is a self-contained module. Adding one is a file and a line
 * here; removing one is deleting both, and nothing else in the service knows the
 * difference — the pipeline asks for a model, the registry decides who serves
 * it, and no copied file mentions any of this.
 *
 * `POLICY_PROVIDERS` narrows the list without a rebuild, which is how a build
 * meant for other people drops the Codex bridge: it runs against one person's
 * subscription on one machine and is no use to anybody else. Set it to
 * `openrouter,azure` and the entry stops being offered, stops being configurable
 * and stops being selectable — including for an install that had already chosen
 * it, which then says so rather than silently calling something else.
