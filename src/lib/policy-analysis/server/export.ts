/**
 * The assessment as a downloadable Word document.
 *
 * The dashboard is a dashboard — hover cards, a drill, filters — and none of
 * that survives being emailed to somebody who has to read it on a train or mark
 * it up before a meeting. Printing to PDF answers half of that and is already
 * wired; a `.docx` answers the other half, which is the copy somebody edits and
 * sends back.
 *
 * Two callers, one document. The owner exports their own assessment; the holder
 * of a share link exports the REDACTED one. They differ only in the artefact
 * list they are handed, because `assessmentMarkdown` is pure — so the two can
 * never drift into different reports, which is the failure this feature's own
 * audit found the first time round.
 *
 * The rendering goes through `synthesize()`, the repo's existing markdown → docx
 * path (`$lib/jkai/extract`), which is how `/projects/dfe-data-strategy` already
 * produces its Word brief. Building OOXML here would be a second one of those.
