/**
 * SEALED RUNS — erasure that does not depend on finding the copies.
 *
 * A `DELETE` cannot give the guarantee this feature was asked for. Anything alive
 * at 02:30 is in up to fourteen nightly `pg_dump`s under `~/backups/vps-pg` and in
 * every restic snapshot beside them; deleted tuples sit in heap pages and WAL
 * until vacuum and checkpoint; and a run's own prose reaches OTHER analyses
 * through cross-policy findings and through the prompts those runs stored. No
 * amount of deleting reaches all of that.
 *
 * So a sealed run never writes readable bytes in the first place. Every free-text
 * column is AES-256-GCM under a key that lives OUTSIDE the database — therefore
 * outside the only thing that is ever pulled off the VPS — and purging the run
 * destroys the key first. Every copy of the ciphertext, wherever it has got to,
 * becomes permanently unreadable at that moment, without anyone having to find
 * it. That is the whole idea; the row deletion afterwards is hygiene.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, and the UI says so at submission rather than at
 * deletion, because submission is when it can still be acted on: the model
 * provider received the document, and if research is enabled the search provider
 * received queries derived from it. Neither is reachable from here.

 * - **`policy_stages.output`** — `{ artefactIds, contractVersion, rejected }`.
 *   Identifiers the pipeline mints, not words from the paper.
 * - **`policy_documents.sha256` and `.size`.** The digest is the run's own
 *   integrity check and never leaves the owner's session; the pack that a share
 *   link produces already withholds it, for the confirmation-oracle reason.
 * - **`policy_model_calls.input` / `.output`.** Not encrypted because a sealed run
 *   DOES NOT WRITE THEM AT ALL. See `provider.ts`.
