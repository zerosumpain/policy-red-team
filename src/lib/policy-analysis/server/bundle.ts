/**
 * THE OFFLINE PACK — an assessment you can take into a room with no network.
 *
 * Print-to-PDF answers half of "give me something to take away" and the Word
 * export answers the half somebody edits. Neither answers the third: the
 * DASHBOARD — the grids, the drill, the stress lab, the interplay map — which
 * is where the assessment is actually read. This is that, as one file.
 *
 * ASSEMBLY IS STRING CONCATENATION, ON PURPOSE. The shell is compiled once at
 * deploy time by `npm run build:offline`; this module reads the two files it
 * produced, wraps them round a payload and zips the result. No headless
 * browser, no bundler in the request path, and the same input always produces
 * the same pack.
 *
 * WHERE THE SHELL LIVES AT RUNTIME: `static/` in a checkout, `build/client/`
 * once the adapter has copied it and ci-deploy has rsynced `build/`. Both are
 * tried, which is the pattern `buildExplainerAssets` already uses. A missing
 * shell fails loudly — a pack that opens to a blank page is worse than a button
 * that says it cannot build one.

WHAT THIS IS
  A red-team assessment of the policy paper named above, packaged so it can be
  read with no network of any kind. Open index.html in any modern browser — by
  double-clicking it, not by serving it — and you get the full dashboard: the
  verdict, the threat, what the policy rests on, and the assessment itself, with
  the same grids, drill-downs and stress test as the live page.

WHAT IS IN THE PACK
  index.html    The dashboard. Everything it draws is inside this one file.
  report.docx   The written assessment, for editing and marking up.
  report.md     The same text as markdown, for pasting into your own template.
  MANIFEST.json Digests of the three files above, so a copy can be checked.
  README.txt    This file.

WHAT IT IS NOT
  This is an adversarial reading, not an assurance review. It sets out to find
  how the paper can be beaten and by whom; it will not tell you the policy is
  fine, and a short list of plays is not a clean bill of health.
${
  payload.withheld.length
    ? `
  This is a SHARED copy. It leaves out the policy document itself — which the
  report cites in short spans rather than reproducing — and any comparison with
  the author's other assessments.
`
    : `
WHAT THIS PACK CONTAINS THAT A SHARED LINK WOULD NOT
  This is the AUTHOR'S OWN copy. It carries the policy document in full — the
  passages the report quotes from — and any cross-policy findings, which name
  other papers the same author has assessed. A link shared from the site
  withholds both. Handle this file like the paper it contains.
`
}
HOW IT WAS MADE
  Pack made          ${payload.generatedAt}
  Assessment status  ${payload.status}
  Completed          ${payload.completedAt ?? 'not recorded'}
  Artefacts          ${payload.artefacts.length}
  Limits recorded    ${payload.warnings.length}
${payload.documentSha256 ? `  Source SHA-256     ${payload.documentSha256}\n` : ''}
  Produced by strangeramblings.com. Nothing in this pack reports back: it makes
  no request to any server, and it will read the same in five years as it does
  today.
