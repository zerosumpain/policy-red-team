// Ranking an exploitation play, deterministically.

// The model judges four things a policy professional can argue with, each on
// [0,1]: how much the actor GAINS, how EASY the play is, how much it costs the
// policy's objective, and how well it hides. The ranking itself is computed here
// rather than asked for, so two runs over the same judgements rank the same way
// and the arithmetic can be shown on the page.
//
// The combination is a geometric mean, not a product: four 0.5s should read as
// 0.5, and a play nobody has any incentive to run should fall to the bottom no
// matter how easy it is. A product does the second but not the first.
