/**
 * THE PURGE RECEIPT — what "I deleted it" is worth without one.
 *
 * A purge that reports success tells you the code ran. It does not tell you that
 * nothing is left, and this feature's own history is the argument: `remove()`
 * looked complete for two months while orphaning queue envelopes, leaving
 * cross-policy prose about the deleted paper on a neighbouring assessment, and
 * leaving that paper's artefacts inside other runs' stored prompts.
 *
 * So the purge ASKS — twelve probes, one per place a reference can live, each
 * returning a count that must be zero — and says plainly what it cannot reach,
 * because a receipt that quietly omits the model provider would be worse than no
 * receipt at all.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS PURE AND THE PAGE IMPORTS IT. The probes themselves are SQL and
 * live in `server/census.ts`; they were in here until the dashboard needed
 * `receiptText` to offer the file, at which point importing this would have
 * pulled drizzle and a database connection into the browser bundle. Nothing under
 * `$lib/policy-analysis/server` carries a `$lib/server` prefix, so SvelteKit
 * would not have stopped it.

The nightly backup does not copy these records at all, so nothing here outlives
the delete by sitting in a copy somewhere. The backup proves that to itself each
night by reading its own output back before keeping the file.

This receipt is not stored anywhere. It exists only as the file you are reading:
a record of the purge, kept in the database it emptied, would be a new trace of
the run it certifies the absence of.
