 * consequence, and the one that was invisible. On the 72-page white paper of
 * 2026-09-10 triage discarded NOTHING, so `discarded` was 0 and this machinery
 * stayed asleep, while the graph itself held 9 nodes and 4 edges for 352 resolved
 * actors. Seven of the eleven checks correctly returned indeterminate on their
 * own, but four produced risk verdicts — one of them `high_risk` — from three
 * assertions, and nothing on the page said those rested on 2.6% of the actors.
