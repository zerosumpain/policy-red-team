 * What the words on this page MEAN.
 *
 * The assessment is a game-theoretic read of a policy paper, and its reader is a
 * policy professional who did not necessarily write the paper and has no reason
 * to know what "concealment" is doing in a ranking or why a check that found
 * nothing is not a pass. Every column type, factor, band and verdict on the page
 * therefore carries an explainer, and they all live here.
 *
 * The split is the one `$lib/health/metric-registry.ts` keeps and for the same
 * reason: this module holds MEANINGS and no values. A term is what it is
 * regardless of which assessment is on screen, so nothing here takes an
 * artefact, and the whole file is testable by reading it.
 *
 * `read` is deliberately the third field. `what` says what the column is, `why`
 * says why the assessment bothers to compute it, and `read` tells you what a
 * HIGH number actually means — which is the one a reader gets wrong, because
 * three of the four exposure factors are bad news when they are high and the
 * fourth is bad news when the policy is good at hiding things from itself.
