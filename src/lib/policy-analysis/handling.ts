/**
 * WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR DOCUMENT — in the words a reader actually uses.
 *
 * A reader deciding whether to put an unpublished paper into this thing is
 * asking one question: where does it go, and can I get it back out of every
 * place it went? Everything needed to answer that already existed — in a spec, a
 * commit message and a schema comment, none of which is on the page.
 *
 * So this is the answer, written once, as data. `HandlingPanel.svelte` draws it
 * as a diagram AND as a list — the list is not a fallback, it is what a screen
 * reader, a printer and the Word export all get, and it carries exactly the same
 * journey. `report-doc.ts` renders it into the document, for the same reason the
 * glossary is rendered there: a paper that lands on somebody's desk has nobody
 * to ask.
 *
 * TWO RULES FOR EDITING THIS FILE:
 *
 * 1. **Behaviour, not mechanism.** "The findings are written down beside the
 *    paper", not "artefacts persist to `policy_artefacts` under the analysis id".
 * 2. **Never overclaim.** Every sentence here is a promise to somebody who is
 *    trusting it with work that is not theirs to leak. If a thing cannot be
 *    guaranteed, this file says so in the same plain words as everything else —
 *    that is what `BEYOND` is for, and it is not an appendix.
