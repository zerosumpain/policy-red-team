/**
 * THE ASSESSMENT AS GRIDS, NOT AS CARDS.
 *
 * The dashboard rebuild of 2026-09-10 put a depth gradient over the content and
 * left the content itself as full-size stacked cards. Measured at 1440px on a
 * nine-body assessment: the playbook was 5,321px tall, the cast 3,541px and the
 * network 4,481px, because eleven plays meant eleven cards and nine bodies meant
 * nine cards each repeating the same six field labels. A reader comparing two
 * bodies had to hold one in their head and scroll.
 *
 * A comparison wants a GRID. Rows are the subjects, columns are the same
 * question asked of each, and every cell is short enough that the eye can run
 * down a column — the long text lives one hover and one click away, which is
 * where the depth gradient already put it. So this module is three derivations,
 * all pure, all testable without mounting anything:
 *
 *  * `traitGrid`   — bodies × what moves them (the cast, as an x-by-y table)
 *  * `playGrid`    — plays × the four factors behind their rank
 *  * `adjacency`   — bodies × bodies, cells naming the relationship families
 *
 * Nothing here asks a model for anything: every column is a field the pipeline
 * already emitted. The clipping is the only new judgement, and it is one
 * function so the three grids clip alike.
