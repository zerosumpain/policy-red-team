/**
 * WHAT AN OFFLINE COPY OF AN ASSESSMENT CONTAINS.
 *
 * The dashboard is already a pure function of its artefacts — every component
 * under `$lib/components/policy-analysis` takes props and makes no request of
 * its own — so an offline copy is the same page with its data inlined rather
 * than loaded. This module decides what goes in, and it is pure so the rule can
 * be tested rather than trusted, exactly as `share.ts` is.
 *
 * TWO SCOPES, ONE BUILDER:
 *
 * - **owner** — the reader's own copy of their own assessment. It carries the
 *   `passage` artefacts, which are the extracted policy document itself. That is
 *   the point: an offline pack is what you take into a room with no network, and
 *   a report you cannot check against its source is half a report.
 * - **shared** — the copy a share link produces. Its artefacts have already
 *   been through `shareableReport` by the time they reach here, so the document
 *   and the reader's other assessments are gone on exactly the same rules as
 *   the shared page. There is no second redaction, deliberately: two
 *   implementations of "what may leave this account" is how a chapter goes
 *   missing from one of them.
 *
 * The payload is versioned because a bundle outlives the code that wrote it. A
 * pack opened in two years should be able to say what it is.
