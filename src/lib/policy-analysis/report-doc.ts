/**
 * The assessment as a document, for Word and for anything else that wants prose.
 *
 * The dashboard is a dashboard: figures, hover cards, a drill. None of that
 * survives being emailed to somebody who needs to read it on a train, and a
 * printed PDF is not a thing a colleague can mark up and send back. So the same
 * artefacts render a second time, as a linear document, and this module is that
 * rendering.
 *
 * PURE, and markdown, for three reasons that all turned out to be the same one.
 * It can be asserted in a test without a database or a headless browser; the
 * SHARED copy can render the identical document simply by handing it the
 * redacted artefact list, so the two can never drift; and the repo already turns
 * markdown into .docx through `synthesize()`, which is how
 * `/projects/dfe-data-strategy` produces its Word brief. Writing an OOXML
 * builder here would be a second one of those.
 *
 * The ORDER is the report's own five acts, not the dashboard's tab strip. A
 * document is read front to back and a dashboard is not, so the exploitation
 * playbook comes after the verdict it explains rather than in a tab beside it.
