/**
 * The relationship readings, and the two things they say about themselves.
 *
 * Six of these readings are structural — a missing counterpart the paper never
 * closes — and they were sound. The faults this file pins are the ones that made
 * the sound readings hard to trust: a headline promising BODIES that named
 * mechanisms, a body counted six times so its degree ranked ninth, and a duty
 * attributed to a charity cited in a footnote. All three were live on the Best
 * Start in Life assessment of 2026-09-11 and none of them is a model's fault.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no mount, no model.
