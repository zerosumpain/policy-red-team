/**
 * What a shared, read-only copy of an assessment may contain.
 *
 * A share link hands a policy professional the report without a login. It must
 * not hand them anything else, and "anything else" here is specific and worth
 * naming, because the owner is sharing ONE assessment out of a private
 * workspace:
 *
 * - **The policy paper itself.** `passage` artefacts hold the extracted document
 *   in full — up to 600,000 characters of somebody's unpublished draft. The
 *   report cites it in short spans (`sourceQuote`, with its page and section),
 *   which is how a report cites; the whole text is not the report.
 * - **The reader's OTHER assessments.** A `cross_policy` artefact names another
 *   analysis by id and title. Sharing this report would disclose the existence,
 *   the titles and the weaknesses of papers the recipient was never given.
 * - **The persona library**, for the same reason: a dossier is drawn from every
 *   assessment that met that body.
 * - **The run log** — prompts, model output, provider, spend, the uploaded file.
 *   That is the owner's audit trail, not part of the assessment.
 *
 * This module is pure so the rule can be tested rather than trusted. The route
 * calls it; nothing else assembles a shared payload.

// leave the account. Upstream withholds stage 13's warnings on that ground and
// ships its output.

/**
 * THE ADDENDA, REDACTED — in a shared copy, and deliberately.
 *
 * The temptation is to withhold them entirely, as the cross-policy chapter and
 * the persona library are withheld. That would be wrong, and dangerously so: a
 * recipient reading a report that an addendum has OVERTURNED needs to know
 * that more than the owner does, because they are the one who may act on it
 * without ever seeing the correction. The judgements are about the report, and
 * the report is what was shared.
 *
 * What does not travel is the ATTACHMENT — a separate document the recipient
 * was never given a link to:
 *
 * - `filename` names a document they cannot open, and a filename is content.
 * - `note` is the owner's own words about why they attached it, written for
 *   nobody else.
 * - `error` can quote the paper, which is why the worker already encrypts it on
 *   a sealed run rather than writing it to the shared queue table.
 * - `size` and `sha256` describe a file that is not in this copy.
 *
 * Its passages do not travel either, and need no rule here: `passage` is
 * already a withheld KIND, so the material's text is dropped with the policy's.
